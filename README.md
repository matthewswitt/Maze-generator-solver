# Maze-generator-solver

Created a random maze generator as well as a solver for the maze. Utilized the backtracking algorithm, worked with stacks and developed a pathfinder.

As seen, every maze generated is random and unique:

After the maze is generated, a pathfinder solves the maze in the quickest way possible. As shown below, sometimes the maze can be solved with a fairly few amount of steps and other time it requires a much longer solution:
